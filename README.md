____________________________________
🔹1. Choose a classification 
  dataset and normalize features

.Pick a dataset like Iris or Wine    from sklearn.datasets or a CSV      file.

.Split data into features (X) and    labels (y).

.Normalize features using            StandardScaler or MinMaxScaler to   ensure equal weight in distance     calculations.

🔹2. Use KNeighborsClassifier from    sklearn

.Import KNeighborsClassifier from    sklearn.neighbors.

.Split data into training and        testing sets with train_test_split.

.Create and train the model using    knn =                              KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=K)  and knn.fit().

🔹3. Experiment with different       values of K

.Try various K values (e.g., 1 to    20).

.For each K, train the model and     test its accuracy.

.Plot K vs accuracy to identify the  best performing value of K.

🔹4. Evaluate model using accuracy,   confusion matrix

.Use predict() on the test data.

.Calculate accuracy using            accuracy_score.

.Generate and visualize the          confusion matrix with               confusion_matrix and seaborn.heatmap.

🔹5. Visualize decision boundaries
 Reduce to two features for 2D       plotting.

.Create a mesh grid covering the     feature space.

.Predict over the grid and use       contourf to plot regions.

.Overlay training points with        scatter.
